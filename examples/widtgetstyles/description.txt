  The TeleNEXus widget style system is useful to expand the capabilities

  Qt Style Sheets. When creating a new style for a widget, one additional rule 
  is used - the widget class name must be replaced with the entry "(...)".

   further use of them using the "style" attribute. For use
   The style described in the WIDGETSTYLES section uses a line like this:
     "$(StyleId)"
     where:
       $()      - key symbols;
       StyleId  - string identifier of the style described 
                  in the WIDGETSTYLE section.
